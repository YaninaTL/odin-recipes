<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="description">Draniki are a simple and wholesome Belarusian appetizer or main, made from the nation's favorite food: the potato.

Potatoes are such an important ingredient in Belarusian cuisine. Neighboring Slovenians have even given Belarusians the nickname 'bulbash', as 'bulba' means potato in Belarus.

Tasty Belarusian potatoes are mashed and flattened into pancakes. They are then placed in a pan and fried in generous amounts of oil and salt.

Draniki are commonly served smothered in steaming gravy or with a sizeable dollop of sour cream.

Despite being a simple Belarusian food, the fresh taste of the native potatoes gives the dish plenty of flavor.

Draniki are a testament to the resilience of Belarusians who had to find ways to feed themselves during cold winters and times of hardship in the country.</p>
