# odin-recipes
My first Odin project. Let's go for it!

What have I learned?
- I mostly practiced flex to see how it worked. The pages that are included were styled differently: the "Draniki" page was created for the desktop, and then my task was to make it more responsive. The "Borscht" page and the "Machanka" page were done in the opposite way, ie, I started with a mobile first design. In conclusion, I want to say that the second way of styling seems more convenient for me at the moment. :)
