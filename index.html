    <h1>Odin Recipes. Belarusian cuisine</h1>
    <h2>Draniki</h2>
    <p>Draniki is one of the most popular and famous dishes of the Belarusian cuisine. Although there are many similar recipes for potato pancakes in various countries, Belarusian draniki is famous for its rich taste, national culinary secrets and the floury Belarusian potatoes – bulba – with their fluffy, dry texture that is perfect for making potato pancakes.</p>
    <h2>Borscht</h2>
    <p>Borscht is a delicious chunky soup that is made of fresh beets, beef shank, onions, carrots, potatoes, cabbage, and dill, then topped with a dollop of sour cream. It's a great recipe for a chilly day!</p>
    <h2>Machanka</h2>
    <p>Machanka is a traditional Belarusian and Ukranian dish. There are many variations of this dish, but here I share a recipe of machanka (sauce) made with pork sausages, beer, onion and sour cream. It's usually served with crepes.</p>
